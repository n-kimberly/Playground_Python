tuples: iterable, ordered
	how come we don't use tuples as a CONSTANT?

sets: Iterable, but Unordered
	sets are nice because they are very fast
	uses hashing

set math:
	moods = {'happy', 'sad', 'grumpy'}
	dwarfs = {'happy', 'grumpy', 'doc'}
		moods | dwarfs  # {'happy', 'sad', 'grumpy', 'doc'}  # union
		moods & dwarfs  # {'happy', 'grumpy'}                # intersection
		moods ^ dwarfs  # {'sad', 'doc'}             		 # symmetric difference
		moods - dwarfs  # {'sad'}
		dwarfs - moods  # {'doc'}

	good for syncing, for example

[expression
 for item in list
 if condition]


big_states = set()
for population in US_STATES_POPULATIONS:
    if population > 1000000:
        big_states.add(population)
big_states = {population
              for population in US_STATES_POPULATIONS
              if population > 1000000}
