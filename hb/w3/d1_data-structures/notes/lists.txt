List

	Overview
		Python allocates contiguous space for items
			Python pre-allocates extra space to grow
		Each block in list is just a pointer (all are same width)

	Indexing a list O(1)
		Pulling value at particular index is O(1)
		index number * width

	Appending to a list O(1)
		Appending a value is O(1) since we just multiply len to width

	Removing from end O(1)
		Similar to append, run to the end, and remove pointer to value
		Garbage collection will delete that value
		Number items gets updated

	Inserting at start/middle O(n)
		Every pointer after change point is adjusted to new value in memory
		Number items gets updated

	Removing from start/middle O(n)
		Similarly, every pointer after change point needs to be adjusted
		Number items gets updated
		Garbage collection removes unused value
