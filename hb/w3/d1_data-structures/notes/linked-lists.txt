Linked Lists

	Overview
		LinkedList.head, tail, nitems (practical)
		LinkedList.head (interview)

	Get item by index O(n)
		Requires walking the list to that index value

	Adding at end O(1)
		Update next of current tail to new node
		Update tail attribute to new noe

	Adding to start O(1)
		Update head to new node
		Connect new node to old head

	Removing from start O(1)
		Point head to current head's next

	Removing from end O(n)
		Must walk through whole list to get to last item
		Update second last item to none
		Update tail attr to second last item


Doubly-Linked Lists

	Removing at end is only O(1)
		This is because we can jump straight to tail from tail attr
		Then walk one step backward to disconnect node
