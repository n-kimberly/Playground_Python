Test demo:
Since this is interactive, let's have a fake input handler:

    >>> import sys
    >>> def fake_input(prompt):
    ...     sys.stdout.write(prompt)
    ...     v = _inputs.pop(0)
    ...     print(v)
    ...     return v

    >>> try:
    ...     import __builtin__ as b    # Python 2
    ... except ImportError:
    ...     import builtins as b       # Python 3

    >>> b.raw_input = b.input = fake_input

Making a fake answer:

    >>> _inputs = ["Balloonicorn", "Balloonicorn"]

Test both demo files:

    >>> import user
    Who are you? Balloonicorn
    Hello, Balloonicorn
    Here I am in game.py
    Who are you? Balloonicorn
    Hello, Balloonicorn
